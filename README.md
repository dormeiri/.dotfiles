# .dotfiles

The 127.0.0.1 of my terminal! If you’re reading this, you’re probably either me, a future me, or lost.

```plain

```

## What’s in here?

- My Neovim config (because I can't quit vim, and not because I can't `:q`)
- Shell tweaks, aliases, and scripts that make my terminal shine
- Some random configs that I probably forgot about

## If you are me, or wanna go YOLO, here is how to set it up

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Once in a while, go YOLO to get the latest updates

```bash
yolo
```
